HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. 
HTTP1.1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
HTTP1.1 is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication.
Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP2. However, it is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security.
HTTP1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP1.0. However, TCP starts slowly and with domain sharding (resources can be downloaded simultaneously by using multiple domains), connection reuse and pipelining, there is an increased risk of network congestion
HTTP2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin along with being less sensitive to network delays
